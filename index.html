            <p>Today marks 1 month and 23 days since our first meet.</p>
            <p>The truth is you are the person that has made me feel</p>
            <p>special for so long. You are the hope I'm holding on to.</p>
            <p>You are one of a kind, especially with ur insidious mind</p>
            <p>But I still want you to be mine, to see how it likes</p>
            <p>...   </p>
            <p>When I said I wanted you I didn't mean only at your best.</p>
            <p>I hope at your worst, when things get messy or even when</p>
            <p>we fight. I want to be close to you and work these out</p>
            <p>Cus it's always been only you, and I love you so...  </p>
            <p>...   </p>
            <p>This year is so memorable to you, pls make fun and aim for the best!!! </p>
            <p>I wish you all, and I'll always support you babi.</p>
